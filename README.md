## Overview
   * Started about 2006 by John Resig
   * Write less do more.
   * Allows you to not worry about the differences in browsers - not as much of a problem now but still is an issue. 
   * Makes working with the DOM much, much easier. 
   * We’ve all been to pages where we see them move, disappear, hide
   and this is how it’s typically done in a web app. How when you
   click a button and it’s replaced by a piece of text.
   * THE go to Javascript library that:
     * [DOM Element Selection](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/)
     * [DOM Element Traversal](http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/)
     * [DOM Manipulation](http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/)
     * [Event handling](http://api.jquery.com/category/events/)
     * [Animation](http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/)
     * [Ajax](http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/)
   * [JQuery](http://jquery.com/)

Define event handlers on the  RecordLabel, Artist and Album

[Person class](https://github.com/tdyer/js_events_lab/blob/master/src/person.js)
 markup
[Person HTML file](https://github.com/tdyer/js_events_lab/blob/master/event_this.html)
and supporting code [Common Code](https://github.com/tdyer/js_events_lab/blob/master/src/common_done.js)
to see how one can use JS object methods as event handlers.
